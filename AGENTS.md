# AGENT Guidelines

## Project Phase Workflow

Felts work is organized by implementation phases under `docs/phases/`, with completed phases archived under `docs/_archived/`.

For each new phase:

1. Start with `grill-with-docs`.
   - Read the relevant phase markdown and existing project docs before asking questions.
   - Ask one decision question at a time.
   - Provide a recommended answer with each question.
   - Update the phase markdown and ADRs as decisions are made.
   - Create ADRs only for meaningful tradeoffs that future contributors would need to understand.

2. Finish and commit the docs first.
   - When grilling is complete, commit the updated docs on `main`.
   - Push the docs commit to `origin/main`.
   - Keep this separate from implementation commits.

3. Start implementation from a new feature branch.
   - Create the feature branch from the latest `main`.
   - Implement according to the finalized phase docs.
   - Keep changes scoped to the phase.
   - Run the relevant checks and live tests described by the phase acceptance criteria.

4. Complete the phase.
   - Commit implementation work on the feature branch.
   - Push the branch and provide PR notes.
   - After the PR lands, checkout `main` and pull.
   - Move the completed phase doc from `docs/phases/` to `docs/_archived/`.
   - Then begin grilling the next phase.

## Coding Guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes and LLM coding pitfalls.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.
